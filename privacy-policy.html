Why do we collect your personal data and how it is used
TopData is a global media intelligence organization and our products enable our customers (“Customers”) to monitor publicly available online content, such as editorial and social media content, by using certain keywords. Customers are interested in knowing how their brand performs compared to their competitors, what the media trends are for their industry and what has been written about topics close to their interests. Our Customers access our services via our online platform and/or mobile application where they can view content matching their queries.
Content and search results delivered byTopData to Customers, based on their keywords, may include your personal data. For example, your personal data may have been included in a news article, or your social media post may have included a key word which is picked up by the searches on the online platform. The collection of your personal data is incidental to TopDatas’ and our Customers' main purposes of monitoring editorial and social media. We receive your personal data because we provide the online platform and technology which powers this monitoring activity. We use your personal data to provide our services to Customers, and for the purposes of displaying, analysing and storing relevant content.

We also allow Customers to search monitored content by author, allowing them to find news articles or social posts written by a specific person.

The personal data we collect is limited to the personal data included in news articles, websites or social media platforms, such as name and approximate location (if enabled). Whilst it is not TopDatas’ or our Customers' goal to collect special categories of personal data about you, this type of personal data may be present in some monitored content (such as in a public article about a person battling a disease or disability).TopData does not collect personal data about you to create any profiles or conduct profiling of you as a data subject.

We have safeguards in place to ensure we do not use your personal data for activities where we believe that our interests are overridden by any unwarranted adverse impact on you.
